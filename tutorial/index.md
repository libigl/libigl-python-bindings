!!! warning
    The igl python binding are in development, consider this a **beta** version.

[libigl](https://libigl.github.io) is a simple C++ geometry processing library. We have a wide functionality including construction of sparse discrete differential geometry operators and finite-elements matrices such as the cotangent Laplacian and diagonalized mass matrix, simple facet, and edge-based topology data structures.

All these functionalities are now available through python and can be easily installed with conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge igl
```

We provide a complete jupyter version of the tutorials and the full [documentation](igl_docs.md).

The full tutorial can be interactively run through mybinder
